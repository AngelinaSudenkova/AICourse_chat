# Global AI Regulation: Trump Administration Pursues Federal Control, EU Simplifies Rules

**Research Query:** AI regulations

## Summary

The Trump administration is preparing a comprehensive executive order to establish the federal government's sole authority over artificial intelligence regulation in the United States. This executive order aims to preempt state-level AI laws, potentially challenging them through litigation and by withholding federal funding. A key component of this initiative is the creation of an "AI Litigation Task Force," overseen by the Attorney General, to enforce federal oversight, alongside a "Genesis Mission" to accelerate US AI development. Concurrently, the European Union is moving in a contrasting direction, scaling back its aggressive stance on Big Tech by implementing a "digital package of simplification" to streamline existing AI and privacy rules.
