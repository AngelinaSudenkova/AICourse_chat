    "aiSummary": "Here's a summary of the top news headlines:\n\nMajor domestic and international developments are in focus today, encompassing security, political disputes, and economic shifts. Two National Guard members were reportedly shot near the White House, marking a significant security incident. Politically, 21 states are suing the Trump administration over new guidance affecting immigrants' SNAP eligibility, arguing it illegally blocks legal permanent residents from receiving food stamps. On the economic front, Canada announced new tariffs on US steel and other imports, while domestically, Black Friday TV deals are widely available with substantial discounts. Corporate ethics are also under scrutiny, as a Campbell's executive is out following a viral alleged rant mocking \"poor\" customers and their products.\n\nPublic health remains a concern with Norovirus cases rising in the U.S. since mid-October, particularly in states like Louisiana, Michigan, and Indiana. In entertainment, Apple TV has pulled the premiere of its show 'The Hunt' amid plagiarism accusations, and musician Jackson Browne announced the death of his 52-year-old son, Ethan Browne. The sports world saw unexpected news with Frank Ragnow coming out of retirement, while the College Football Playoff system continues to draw criticism for its structure, driven by what Sports Illustrated describes as \"greed\" and its impact on competitive balance.",
