    "aiSummary": "Top news headlines reveal a mix of significant geopolitical developments, critical health policy shifts, and domestic concerns.\n\nInternationally, Pope Leo made a historic visit to Istanbul's Blue Mosque, marking his first attendance at a Muslim place of worship since taking the papacy, signaling efforts in interfaith dialogue. Concurrently, Ukraine faces political instability as a widening corruption scandal forced the resignation of Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's powerful right-hand man. A major health policy shift is anticipated in the U.S. as the FDA plans to impose strict new vaccine requirements, with the nation's top vaccine regulator claiming a link between child COVID shots and deaths.\n\nDomestically, a stalled abuse investigation at Seton Hall University is drawing scrutiny, with accusations that the school is attempting to \"silence the truth\" from its former president. Meanwhile, a positive human interest story emerged from a Louisiana prison, where a \"father-daughter dance\" aimed to restore family bonds. On the weather front, Michigan is bracing for a significant snowstorm with increased winter storm warnings. Other news includes Oscar Piastri's dominant Formula 1 Sprint victory, a toddler's inspiring recovery from a grim cancer prognosis, and the ongoing push for Black Friday tech deals. Scientific headlines rounded out the week with discussions on an enigmatic human relative, dark matter, and mysterious lights during nuclear weapons tests.",
